This is an interactive game to help students practise projectile motion. You are intended to derive the vertical and horizontal components of motion to hit the target (the only force acting on the object in motion is gravity). Although the game has a stroke count feature, the purpose of the game is to help students practise their knowledge in projectile motion and should be aiming to hit the target in 1 stroke. Having a piece of paper for working out is recommended.
